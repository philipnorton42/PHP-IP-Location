PHP IP Location Library

Use in the following manner.

$objIpLocationObject = new IpLocation_Ip(new IpLocation_Service_GeoIp());
$results = $objIpLocationObject->getIpLocation('66.102.9.105'); // google.com IP address
print_r($results); // Print out the results object

The IpLocation_Ip class can take a number of services.

There is also a IpLocation_Url class for converting URL's into locations.
